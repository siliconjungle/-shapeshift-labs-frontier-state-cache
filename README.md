## Install

```sh
npm install @shapeshift-labs/frontier @shapeshift-labs/frontier-query @shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache
```

Install mutation too if you use the mutation bridge:

```sh
npm install @shapeshift-labs/frontier-mutation
```

## Usage

```js
import { createQueryCache } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache';

const cache = createQueryCache();
const key = ['todos', { status: 'open' }];

cache.writeQuery(key, [
  { __typename: 'Todo', id: 't1', text: 'ship', done: false }
]);

cache.watchQuery(key, (patch) => {
  console.log('query patch', patch);
});

cache.modifyEntity('Todo:t1', (todo) => ({
  ...todo,
  done: true
}));

console.log(cache.getQueryData(key));
```

## API

```ts
import {
  createQueryCache,
  createQueryCacheChangeLog,
  createQueryCacheMemoryStorageAdapter,
  mergeOffsetPage,
  mergeUniqueList,
  persistQueryCache,
  summarizeQueryCacheChanges,
  type QueryCache,
  type QueryCacheCatchUpResult,
  type QueryCacheDependencyNode,
  type QueryCacheMaintainedQueryOptions
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache';
```

Core exports:

- `createQueryCache(options?)` creates an in-memory normalized query cache.
- `cache.writeQuery(key, data, options?)` stores a query result and normalizes identifiable entities.
- `cache.getQueryData(key)` reads the current denormalized query result.
- `cache.modifyEntity(entity, updater)` updates one normalized entity and repairs dependent query snapshots.
- `cache.removeEntity(entity)` removes one normalized entity, repairs dependent query snapshots, and emits the entity removal through the same deferred batch/change-log path as writes.
- `cache.maintainQuery(key, options?)` keeps a derived query result repaired from normalized entities.
- `cache.setDependencyNode(node)` and `cache.invalidateDependency(id)` track explicit producer-supplied dependency DAGs for derived query invalidation.
- `cache.readQueryCatchUp(key, { lastSeenClock?, limit? })` reads per-query element changes newer than a subscriber's stored clock.
- `cache.getQueryCatchUpClock(key)` returns the current high-water catch-up clock for a query.
- `cache.watchQuery(key, callback)` subscribes to compact Frontier patches for one query.
- `cache.watchEntity(entity, callback)` subscribes to compact Frontier patches for one entity.
- `cache.invalidateQueries(filter?)` and `cache.invalidateEntity(entity)` mark affected queries stale.
- `cache.optimistic(layerId, callback)`, `resolveOptimistic(layerId)`, and `rollbackOptimistic(layerId)` manage optimistic layers.
- `cache.extract()` and `cache.restore(snapshot)` move cache state across storage boundaries.

### Maintained Queries

Use maintained queries for generic top-k, latest-N, filtered-list, or query-repair views that should update when normalized entities change:

```js
const topOpen = ['todos', { status: 'open', top: 10 }];

const handle = cache.maintainQuery(topOpen, {
  filter: (entity) => entity.__typename === 'Todo' && entity.status === 'open',
  sort: (left, right, leftId, rightId) => (
    Number(right.score) - Number(left.score) || leftId.localeCompare(rightId)
  ),
  limit: 10,
  select: (entity) => ({
    __typename: 'Todo',
    id: entity.id,
    score: entity.score,
    title: entity.title
  })
});

cache.modifyEntity('Todo:t1', (todo) => ({ ...todo, score: Number(todo.score) + 1 }));
console.log(cache.getQueryData(topOpen));

handle.unsubscribe();
```

### Subscription Catch-Up Clocks

Use query catch-up clocks when a subscriber reconnects with a stored `lastSeenClock` and should receive only rows changed since that clock:

```js
const key = ['todos', { status: 'open' }];

cache.writeQuery(key, [
  { __typename: 'Todo', id: 't1', title: 'Ship', done: false }
]);

const first = cache.readQueryCatchUp(key);
sendToClient(first.changes);

cache.modifyEntity('Todo:t1', (todo) => ({ ...todo, done: true }));

const next = cache.readQueryCatchUp(key, {
  lastSeenClock: first.highWaterClock,
  limit: 64
});

sendToClient(next.changes);
storeClientClock(next.nextLastSeenClock);
```

Catch-up clocks are monotonically increasing server-side metadata outside the JSON value. Entity rows, maintained-query insertions, and maintained-query removals receive per-query clocks; scalar or aggregate query rewrites fall back to a full query-value catch-up record. `limit` responses set `complete: false` and advance `nextLastSeenClock` only to the last emitted change.

### Dependency DAG Invalidation

Use dependency nodes when an application already knows the footprint for a derived result, such as a route, compiler artifact, order-book slice, or dashboard aggregate. Frontier does not trace reads; producers supply stable dependency ids.

```js
const routeKey = ['route', { id: 'a' }];

cache.writeQuery(routeKey, { id: 'a', eta: 12 });
cache.setDependencyNode({ id: 'segment:a', dependencies: ['edge:1', 'traffic:1'] });
cache.setDependencyNode({ id: 'route:a', dependencies: ['segment:a'], queryKey: routeKey });

const result = cache.invalidateDependency('traffic:1');
console.log(result.invalidated); // 1
```

`setDependencyNode()` rejects cycles, `deleteDependencyNode(id)` removes a node and its edges, and `invalidateDependency(id)` walks reverse edges to mark only reachable attached queries stale.

### Entity Identity

By default entities are identified by `__typename` plus `id` or `_id`.

```js
const cache = createQueryCache({
  identify(value) {
    if (value.kind === 'Issue' && typeof value.slug === 'string') {
      return 'Issue:' + value.slug;
    }
    return null;
  }
});
```

### Merge Policies

`writeQuery()` accepts merge functions for pagination and list repair:

```js
import { mergeOffsetPage, mergeUniqueList } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache';

cache.writeQuery(['todos'], nextPage, {
  merge: (existing, incoming) => mergeOffsetPage(existing, incoming, { offset: 40 })
});

cache.writeQuery(['todos'], incomingRows, {
  merge: (existing, incoming) => mergeUniqueList(existing, incoming, { key: 'id' })
});
```

### Persistence And Change Logs

```js
import {
  createQueryCacheChangeLog,
  createQueryCacheMemoryStorageAdapter,
  persistQueryCache
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache';

const storage = createQueryCacheMemoryStorageAdapter();
const persistence = persistQueryCache(cache, storage, {
  autoHydrate: true,
  debounceMs: 100,
  compactOnFlush: true,
  replayChangeLog: true,
  scheduler
});

await persistence.ready;
await persistence.flush();

const log = createQueryCacheChangeLog(cache, { capacity: 256 });
const entries = log.readSince(log.checkpoint);
```

`persistQueryCache()` owns hydrate/flush/debounce scheduling for the cache. Pass a structural `scheduler` to route save work through a deterministic lane with backpressure; without one it falls back to the package-local debounce path. The returned `persistence.ready` promise resolves the first auto-hydrate attempt. Storage adapters that expose `appendChange(entry)` also receive durable change-log entries automatically unless `changeLog: false` is passed; if they also expose `readChangeLog()`, persistence seeds new entries from the highest retained `seq` after a restart.

Pass `replayChangeLog: true` to hydrate a stored snapshot and then apply retained post-checkpoint query/entity/invalidation entries from `readChangeLog()`. This is intentionally opt-in: adapters should pair it with `compactOnFlush: true` or an equivalent checkpoint policy so retained log entries represent changes after the loaded snapshot. Storage adapters that expose `compact(snapshot)` can be used with `compactOnFlush: true` to checkpoint a snapshot and trim adapter-owned logs during flush. When the cache can expose an owned snapshot, the compact path keeps that snapshot compact instead of paying for an extra deep clone.

Use `getQueryCacheOwnedSnapshot(cache)` when you need the cache's by-reference snapshot directly. `cache.extract()` still returns a deep-cloned snapshot for external mutation safety, while the owned helper is what persistence uses for compact flushes and storage adapters that can retain ownership.

### Mutation Bridge

The mutation bridge is isolated in an optional subpath so normal cache imports do not load mutation planning code:

```js
import { createMutationPlan, select } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-mutation';
import {
  cacheMutationAccessesConflict,
  commitCacheQueryMutation,
  getCacheQueryMutationAccess
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache/mutation';

const plan = createMutationPlan()
  .forEach(select('/*').where('done', '==', false).keyBy('id'), (rows) => {
    rows.set('done', true);
  });

const result = commitCacheQueryMutation(cache, ['todos', { status: 'open' }], plan, { access: true });
const retryAccess = getCacheQueryMutationAccess(['todos', { status: 'open' }], plan);

console.log(result.patch);      // mutation patch
console.log(result.cachePatch); // cache watcher patch
console.log(cacheMutationAccessesConflict(result.access, retryAccess));
```

Mutation bridge exports:

- `compileCacheQueryMutation(cache, key, plan, options?)` compiles a plan against a cached query without committing it.
- `commitCacheQueryMutation(cache, key, plan, options?)` writes the resulting query value back to the cache.
- `commitCacheEntityMutation(cache, entity, plan, options?)` compiles and commits a plan against one normalized entity.
- `getCacheQueryMutationAccess(...)`, `getCacheEntityMutationAccess(...)`, and `cacheMutationAccessesConflict(...)` expose opt-in read/write/effect metadata for optimistic safety and batching. Passing `{ access: true }` attaches the metadata to commit results.

## Subpath Imports

```ts
import { createQueryCache } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache';
import { commitCacheEntityMutation } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state-cache/mutation';
```

## Package Scope

This package owns normalized query-result storage:

- query-key hashing and partial matching through `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-query`,
- entity normalization and denormalized query repair,
- query/entity patch watchers,
- optimistic layers,
- persistence snapshots and bounded change logs,
- optional mutation bridge helpers.

It does not own selector syntax, core diff/apply, planned diff engines, CRDT documents, sync providers, rich text, or patch codecs.

## TypeScript

The package ships ESM JavaScript plus `.d.ts` declarations for the root export and the `./mutation` subpath. The package-local TypeScript source lives in `src/` and compiles directly to `dist/`.
